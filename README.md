## About
This repository contains a collection of projects I've developed as part of my academic studies. Each project represents an opportunity to apply and expand upon the skills and knowledge gained in various programming courses. These projects range from simple web pages to more complex layouts, all built using HTML and CSS at this stage. Future iterations will incorporate additional technologies such as JavaScript, ReactJS, Python, Node.js, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes media queries for optimal viewing across devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes hover effects, animations, and other interactive elements to engage users.
- **Custom Styling**: Custom CSS styles tailored to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of the portfolio.

## Technologies Used
At this time, only HTML and CSS are being used for development:
- HTML5: Structure and content of web pages.
- CSS3: Styling and layout of web pages.
